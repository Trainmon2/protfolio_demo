        <h2 class="binder-title">Origin</h2>

        <p>
          There was a point where I stopped trying to avoid complexity and started leaning
          into it. Instead of stepping back from confusion, I learned how to step into it
          with structure, patience, and intention.
        </p>

        <p>
          Debugging code taught me how to stay calm under pressure, break problems into
          manageable parts, and keep moving forward even when progress was slow.
          That discipline carried over into everything I do.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, I approach challenges the same way I approach development: identify the
          issue, understand the system, and solve it one step at a time.
        </p>

          <h3>Starfield & Background System Debugging</h3>

          <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
          <p>
            The starfield background system stopped working correctly. Stars disappeared,
            content became invisible, and small changes caused major visual breakage across
            the page.
          </p>

          <p><strong>What I Was Seeing</strong></p>
          <p>
            Stars rendered inconsistently, page content was hidden behind background layers,
            and z-index changes fixed one issue while breaking another.
          </p>

          <p><strong>What Was Actually Happening</strong></p>
          <p>
            The issue was not a single bug but a system conflict. Background layers competed
            for the same stacking context, and unrelated JavaScript interfered.
          </p>

          <p><strong>How I Fixed It</strong></p>
          <p>
            I rebuilt the system intentionally by isolating the starfield, removing unrelated
            scripts, and reestablishing a clear layer order.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Result</strong></p>
          <p>
            The starfield rendered consistently, content remained readable, and the page
            became stable and predictable.

          <h3>JavaScript Conflict — Arena JS vs Page JS</h3>

          <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
          <p>
            Page behavior became unpredictable. Animations triggered unexpectedly and
            features stopped working.
          </p>

          <p><strong>What Was Actually Happening</strong></p>
          <p>
            JavaScript from a different page was running globally without required DOM
            elements.
          </p>

          <p><strong>How I Fixed It</strong></p>
          <p>
            I separated concerns and ensured scripts only ran where intended.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Result</strong></p>
          <p>
            Pages stopped interfering with each other and behavior became predictable.

          <h3>Poster Card Layout, Overflow & Clipping Fixes</h3>

          <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
          <p>
            Poster content was clipped or cut off across screen sizes.
          </p>

          <p><strong>What Was Actually Happening</strong></p>
          <p>
            Overflow and container constraints restricted usable space.
          </p>

          <p><strong>How I Fixed It</strong></p>
          <p>
            I adjusted overflow behavior and padding to respect visual boundaries.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Result</strong></p>
          <p>
            Layouts stabilized and cards became intentional.

           DISCIPLINE
      ========================== -->
     <section class="binder-section" id="discipline">
  <h2 class="binder-title">Discipline</h2>

  <p><strong>How I Work When Things Don’t Go Smoothly</strong></p>
  <p>
    I didn’t build my skills in ideal conditions. I learned while balancing full-time work,
    limited time, and real-world responsibilities. Because of that, discipline for me isn’t
    about motivation — it’s about consistent behavior under friction.
  </p>
<h3 class="binder-subtitle">What This Looks Like in Practice</h3>

  <p>
    When development gets uncomfortable or unclear, I default to structure instead of
    avoidance:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>I break problems down rather than stepping away from them</li>
    <li>I keep working even when progress is slow or non-linear</li>
    <li>I debug methodically instead of rushing fixes</li>
    <li>I continue building without needing external pressure</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I don’t wait for perfect momentum. I work with the conditions I have.
  </p>

  <p><strong>How This Shows Up in My Development Work</strong></p>
  <p>Discipline is what allows me to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Stay engaged when systems break or behave unexpectedly</li>
    <li>Isolate issues instead of abandoning projects</li>
    <li>Make steady progress through uncertainty</li>
    <li>Finish what I start, even when solutions aren’t obvious</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This is the same approach I bring to code, debugging, and learning new systems.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Why This Matters on a Team</strong></p>
  <p>
    Software development isn’t just about knowing syntax — it’s about reliability when
    things fail. The habits I’ve built translate directly into a team environment:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Consistent follow-through</li>
    <li>Comfort working within structure and constraints</li>
    <li>Accountability for outcomes, not excuses</li>
    <li>Openness to feedback and iteration</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I don’t disappear when problems surface. I stay present, work through them, and move
    projects forward.

      <!-- =========================
           NEXT OBJECTIVE
      ========================== -->
      <section class="binder-section" id="next-objective">
  <h2 class="binder-title">Career Direction</h2>

  <p>
    I am seeking an entry-level software developer role where I can contribute
    immediately while continuing to grow as an engineer.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m looking to join a team that values:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Clear communication</li>
    <li>Thoughtful problem-solving</li>
    <li>Maintainable, well-structured code</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I’m not looking for perfection — I’m looking for an environment where learning
    and improvement are expected.
  </p>

  <p><strong>What I Bring</strong></p>
  <p>
    I bring a mindset built around:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Diagnosing problems instead of avoiding them</li>
    <li>Staying calm when systems break</li>
    <li>Finishing what I start</li>
    <li>Learning quickly through real-world challenges</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I approach development with patience, curiosity, and accountability — the same
    way I’ve approached building my skills so far.
  </p>

  <p><strong>How I Plan to Grow</strong></p>
  <p>
    In a junior role, my focus is to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Learn established codebases</li>
    <li>Improve through code reviews and feedback</li>
    <li>Strengthen backend and frontend fundamentals</li>
    <li>Contribute reliable, thoughtful work over time</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I take coaching seriously and value clarity over ego.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Why I’m Ready</strong></p>
  <p>
    I’m ready because I’ve already built the habits required to succeed:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Consistency over shortcuts</li>
    <li>Process over panic</li>
    <li>Growth over comfort</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I don’t expect an easy path — I’m prepared for a real one.
